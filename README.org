* Basic usage
flac2ogg.py /path/to/music/ /mnt/sdcard/
This will copy the entire tree under music and recode the supported formats to an ogg file with quality 8 using as many concurrent processes as you have cores

* Implicit directory name
flac2ogg.py /path/to/album
This will create a new directory which is the basename of the first argument, in this case album

* Possible arguments
flac2ogg.py -o "-a Test" -q 10 -t 4 /path/to/music/ /mnt/sdcard/
This will recode all supported formats, set the artist to test, the quality to 10 and use 4 concurrent processes
